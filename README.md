## Quickly and easily generate a README for any project or application you are working on. 

Here is a link to a video demonstrating how to use the application: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1i78dPgzuuyWZQahRkLtOHqojwkAHkTZm/view?usp=sharing

## Description

Having trouble writing a README.md file for your program? Can't figure out how to get a license badge at the top of your README? Look no further! With this simple to use Node.js application, we got you covered. 

By invoking several techniques such as arrow functions, literal templates, reading/writing files, modularization, and spread/rest operators, we were able to write a simple to use, easy to read application for generating README files. 

## Installation

In order to use this application you need to ensure you have Node.js installed, as well as the npm package, inquirer (specifically version 8.2.4). After ensuring you have these two applications, you can create your own README.md file in no time.
